:bf:That ain't my fault, mystery man. I didn't come here willingly!
:shuffle:And that's why we're here.
:shuffle:Another song would've left your pixels strewn across the ropes, my friend.

:shuffle:... You're a sweet-talker, huh.
:shuffle:Alright. One more, but you've gotta rush out after. 
:bf:Deal!
