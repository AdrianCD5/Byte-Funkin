:bf:Gh...
:skate:I take it you're the Bytefriend everyone's chatterin' about.
:bf:Yeah...? What about it, Boxman?!
:skate:Gumball, you're not there yet. The name's Skatebyte.
:bf:You all really do have 'byte' in your name.
:skate:Yessir! And you, my friend, are breaching the territory.
:bf:You BROUGHT ME HERE!
:skate:Details, Sour Patch Kid. Details.
:skate:Truth is, you've made a splash in mere minutes.
:skate:Tennis folks are already gathering at Boxbanned.
:bf:Hah! I'm just too popular, skater boy.
:skate:Hence why I wanted a piece of the action. Had to force you here for a chance to battle.
:bf:Could've been more generous with the landing...
:skate:Yeah yeah, whatever. Answer the call I'm giving, buddy.
:skate:Y'wanna do a round or two against me?
:bf:Well... obviously! You've got a mic, I have the talent! Let's throw down!
:skate:That's the spirit!
