:bf:Not shabby in the slightest!
:paddle:Same with you, though it's to be expected.
:bf:Hell yeah! You don't mess with BF.
:bf:Speaking of, what's this about a bodyguard?
:paddle:Well, there's a way to get out of here pretty easily, Boyfriend.
:paddle:Unfortunately, it's closest to the game called 'Boxbanned'.
:paddle:You'll have to get through Boxbyte to leave, bud.
:bf:... Do you all just have 'byte' in your names?
:paddle:It's tradition. Which is why you - Boyfriend, - are now Bytefriend.
:bf:...
:bf:I can live with that.
:paddle:Good to hear.
:paddle:One more song before I leave you to Boxbyte, BF.
:bf:Right on!
:paddle:Heh.
:paddle:You're cool.
